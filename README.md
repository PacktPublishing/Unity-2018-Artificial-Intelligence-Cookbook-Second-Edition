Interactive and engaging games come with intelligent enemies, and this intellectual behavior is combined with a variety of techniques collectively referred to as Artificial Intelligence. Exploring Unity's API, or its built-in features, allows limitless possibilities when it comes to creating your game's worlds and characters. This cookbook covers both essential and niche techniques to help you take your AI programming to the next level.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create intelligent pathfinding agents with popular AI techniques such as A* and A* mbush
* Implement different algorithms for adding coordination between agents and tactical algorithms for different purposes
* Simulate senses so agents can make better decisions, taking account of the environment
* Explore different algorithms for creating decision-making agents that go beyond simple behaviors and movement
* Create coordination between agents and orchestrate tactics when dealing with a graph or terrain
